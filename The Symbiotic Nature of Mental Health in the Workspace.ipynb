Whether the saliency of this issue is due to a wealth and abundance which allows our society the luxury to explore these problems, or whether the problem of mental health itself has been elevated as a direct result of our overstimulated and consumer driven world, is not quite uncertain.\n",

    "When we analyze correlational data, we see that Mental Health Concerns tend to decrease both when a company provides more access to care and when there is more Social Support for an individual within the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understandably, there are a lot of caveats to the data. For one, the R-Value for Social Support is somewhat low. Outliers may be skewing the relationship, or perhaps there is a lack of sufficient data to properly evaluate the relationship. There can also be questions raised as to the methodology here, as aggregating multiple variables into a single representative variable can mask underlying relationships at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there is some meat here as far as a cursory analysis is concerned. It's obvious that, at minimum, there are benefits to employee wellbeing when proper access to mental health care is provided by a company. Additional avenues of inquiry that could produce interesting results would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diving into which specific variable out of all the aggregated ones has the strongest correlation, helping drive towards more tangible and substantive policy implementations\n",
    "- Exploring company policies regarding mental health as they relate to growth and productivity metrics"
